## What is it?

*  open-source MLOps framework
*  abstraction layer to a variety of technology stacks

## Architectural Components

* Feature and Artifact Store
* Elastic Serverless Runtimes:  Kubernetes/Nuclio/Dask/Spark/Horovod
* ML Pipeline Automation:  data prep/modeling/real-time pipelines/monitoring
* Central Management: UI/CLI/SDK

## Key Features

* Speed of deployment
* Elastic scaling of batch and real-time jobs
* Feature management system
* Runs anywhere

## Core Concepts

* Project
* Function
* Run
* Artifact
* Workflow
* UI


## Getting started with official docs

* Locally use Docker Desktop as described in [Install MLRun on a Kubernetes Cluster](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/latest/install.html#install-mlrun-on-a-kubernetes-cluster)

* Select "enable Kubernetes" in Docker Desktop
* Install helm `brew install helm`


## Getting Started via manual install and Github README 

* Install (Make sure you have the latest `pip`).  Install on OS X will take several minutes and requires Rust and Cython.

* Create and source a python virtualenv:  `python3 -m venv ~/.mlrun-notes && source ~/.mlrun-notes/bin/activate`
`pip install --upgrade pip && pip install mlrun`


## Common Install Errors and Gotchas for Manual Install

### Operating Specific:
#### OS X 
 
 Can take 30+ minutes to install and contains many dependency errors.
 
  * install latest Python and Rust):  `brew install python` and `brew install rust`  
  * `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Cython'`
  * `RuntimeError: cargo not found in PATH. Please install rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and try again`
  * `clang: error: the clang compiler does not support 'faltivec', please use -maltivec and include altivec.h explicitly`
  * `ERROR: Could not build wheels for maturin, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects`

#### Github Codespaces

* Install only takes a couple of minutes to install

### Tutorial Specific:

* [Automated Code Deployment and Containerization-Example](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun#automated-code-deployment-and-containerization)

```

* Replace README.md with [official docs link which is up to date and mentions Docker based workflows](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/latest/tutorial/01-mlrun-basics.html#introduction-to-mlrun)


## Potential Enhancements

* Hello World example in "one line"
* Target environment recommendation:  Github Codespaces, AWS Cloudshell, etc
* Hello World using a pre-built Docker pull command
* Separate demos with foolproof "hello world" commands for each architectural component
* More clear link to official docs
